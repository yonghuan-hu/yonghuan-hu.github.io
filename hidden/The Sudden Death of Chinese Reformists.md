# The Sudden Death of Chinese Reformists

Oct 22 2022

History will remember the day -- the twenty-second of October, 2022 -- with no mercy or sympathy. A dictator and murderer, once again, fulfilled his selfish dream to stay in power, at the cost of the future of his regime and subjects. I do not blame the apathetic people who choose not to revolt, as it has been more than thirty years since their last attempt, which resulted in a massacre. But some of us will never forget, nor will we accept the victory of autocracy. Down with the traitor of our nation!
