            <p>
                This week we kicked off our project, a brave new world of VR + mental care!
                Initial features include:
            <ul>
                <li>An open world environment that includes varied terrain as the game's home scene.</li>
                <li>An interactive stress relief mini-game where players can grab a hammer and break objects, with
                    satisfying visual and sound effects.</li>
                <li>A castle building and teleportable road signs to host future mini games.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-success">Project vision</h3>
            <p>
                Entering Michigan as a Freshman could be one of the most stressfull times in a persons life, and many of us come ill equiped. Serviced through CAPS, and financed by the University, we hope to make our program a staple of incoming freshman orientation.
                Each Minigame is intended to combat a common problem for incoming freshman. Our Phobia Palisade will help students adjust to the small dorm rooms, or having to work campus alone at night.
                Our Mindfullness Mansion, will help students combat both stress and every day level of anxieties by practicing keeping a calm mind. 
                Our Make a Mind Palace, will inspire students to study more and be more willing to ask questions in lab and office hours.
                And our Stress Relief Stronghold will get rid of all those excited nervous energy that comes with a brand new adventure.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-success">Minigame ideas</h3>
            <p><b>Phobia's Palisade:</b> Face your fears, whether they be heights or dogs, and take control of the
                situation. In this minigame, you will be tasked with stepping across the length of two castles across a
                small bridge.
                For each step you take, your score goes up. For every 50 steps, a special prize is unlocked. You can
                quit at anytime with no punishment.
                This utilizes CBT, cause at each stage you feel better the further you go. We are cognitively connecting
                the feeling of awards with facing your fears in real time.
            </p>
            <p><b>Mindfullness Mansion:</b> A chance to practice mindfullness, in the most stressfull of situations. You
                have a monster chasing you, and if he catches you, you lose all your points. You can't fight back, you
                can't run, you need to take deep breaths and focus.
                First, you must find the four rubber ducks within the samll room you are in. Next, you must push the
                buttons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in order. Finally, you must walk over to the door and push the release button.
                These normally simple tasks, are made difficult by the stressful environment you are in, but provide a
                chance to practice being mindful of your sorroundings in such a tense situation.</p>
            </p>
            <p><b>Make a Mind Palace:</b> Create your own mind palace within the familiar confines of BB Lab.
                For each question you ask, for each product you complete, you will be rewarded, not just monetarily but
                also with feedback from the teachers.
                You can even find a list of EECS classes on the computers within the lab. All of this to make you more
                comfortable at Michigan.
            </p>
            <p><b>Stress Relief Stronghold:</b> Smash pots like you are Link! Throw Hammers like you are Thor! Jump
                100 feet into the air and land in your favorite pose! We all need to destress sometimes,
                and since it is unhealthy to take that stress out on the real world, we'll let you take it out on ours.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-success">Pricing plan</h3>
            <p>
                The game will be available free-to-play, with additional downloadable contents released seasonally.
