            <p>
                <b>Map</b>: One of the largest problems we found in playtesting was that, without guidance, players get lost easily in the game. In response, we added a map which clearly displays paved pathways and destinations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Level switching</b>: Minigames are now built into separate levels and players can travel between worlds, each featuring a unique theme. This also benefits further development as it allows developers to work in parallel, with no need to worrying about conflicts.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-success">Tutorials</h3>

            </div>
            <p>
                In order to win first-time VR users, we redesigned the scene and terrain to provide less choices in the early stage of the game. We have also added tutorials on methods of interactions near the spawn point. The guided walk-through makes it easier for players to acquire the game, which also helps the growth.

                <b>Stress Relief Stronghold</b>: Players can now break things with a hammer in a safe and enclosed environment. From smashing vases to breaking barrels, this minigame provides an immersive and satisfying way to relieve stress and tension. With this feature, we aim to provide players with a healthy outlet to let off steam and feel refreshed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Phobia's Palisade</b>: We're excited to announce a new addition to Make a Mind™ that helps players overcome their fear of heights. The mini-game lets players stand on a transparent platform and slide between castles in a skybridge-like mechanism. However, with the help of VR technology, players do not have to move by themselves -- all they need to do is standing still. By providing a gradual approach to confronting acrophobia, we aim to help players overcome their fears in a safe and controlled environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other two minigames have also been prototyped and are under rapid development.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-success">Next steps</h3>
            <p>
                We expect to finalize the main content of 4 free minigames over the next iteration. Beyond that, we will start exploring extra contents as an addition to the free version of the game.

            <p>
                This week we kicked off our project, a brave new world of VR + mental care!
                Initial features include:
            <ul>
                <li>An open world environment that includes varied terrain as the game's home scene.</li>
                <li>An interactive stress relief mini-game where players can grab a hammer and break objects, with
                    satisfying visual and sound effects.</li>
                <li>A castle building and teleportable road signs to host future mini games.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-success">Project vision</h3>
            <p>
                Entering Michigan as a Freshman could be one of the most stressfull times in a persons life, and many of us come ill equiped. Serviced through CAPS, and financed by the University, we hope to make our program a staple of incoming freshman orientation.
                Each Minigame is intended to combat a common problem for incoming freshman. Our Phobia Palisade will help students adjust to the small dorm rooms, or having to work campus alone at night.
                Our Mindfullness Mansion, will help students combat both stress and every day level of anxieties by practicing keeping a calm mind. 
                Our Make a Mind Palace, will inspire students to study more and be more willing to ask questions in lab and office hours.
                And our Stress Relief Stronghold will get rid of all those excited nervous energy that comes with a brand new adventure.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-success">Minigame ideas</h3>
            <p><b>Phobia's Palisade:</b> Face your fears, whether they be heights or dogs, and take control of the
                situation. In this minigame, you will be tasked with stepping across the length of two castles across a
                small bridge.
                For each step you take, your score goes up. For every 50 steps, a special prize is unlocked. You can
                quit at anytime with no punishment.
                This utilizes CBT, cause at each stage you feel better the further you go. We are cognitively connecting
                the feeling of awards with facing your fears in real time.
            </p>
            <p><b>Mindfullness Mansion:</b> A chance to practice mindfullness, in the most stressfull of situations. You
                have a monster chasing you, and if he catches you, you lose all your points. You can't fight back, you
                can't run, you need to take deep breaths and focus.
                First, you must find the four rubber ducks within the samll room you are in. Next, you must push the
                buttons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in order. Finally, you must walk over to the door and push the release button.
                These normally simple tasks, are made difficult by the stressful environment you are in, but provide a
                chance to practice being mindful of your sorroundings in such a tense situation.</p>
            </p>
            <p><b>Make a Mind Palace:</b> Create your own mind palace within the familiar confines of BB Lab.
                For each question you ask, for each product you complete, you will be rewarded, not just monetarily but
                also with feedback from the teachers.
                You can even find a list of EECS classes on the computers within the lab. All of this to make you more
                comfortable at Michigan.
            </p>
            <p><b>Stress Relief Stronghold:</b> Smash pots like you are Link! Throw Hammers like you are Thor! Jump
                100 feet into the air and land in your favorite pose! We all need to destress sometimes,
                and since it is unhealthy to take that stress out on the real world, we'll let you take it out on ours.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-success">Pricing plan</h3>
            <p>
                The game will be available free-to-play, with additional downloadable contents released seasonally.
